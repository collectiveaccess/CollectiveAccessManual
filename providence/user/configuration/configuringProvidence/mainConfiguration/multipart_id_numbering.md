title: Multipart numbering
---

The MultiPartIDNumber plug-in provides a flexible means to generate
structured numbering systems such as accession numbers within
CollectiveAccess. For most numbering schemes employed by museums and
archives it should be possible to configure a convenient user interface
and adequate validation rules using only the plug-in and without any
custom programming.

The MultiPartIDNumber plug-in requires an ID number *format* for each
item in CollectiveAccess that supports ID numbers. A format is composed
of *elements* joined together by a *separator*. Each element in a format
has settings specified that determine what input is valid for it and how
it will behave in the user interface. An ID number is constructed by
stringing together the individual elements using separators. By
combining various types of elements you can create arbitrarily complex
numbering systems.

# The multipart_id_numbering.conf configuration file

The file defines the formats used by the MultiPartIDNumber plug-in. It
is a standard CollectiveAccess configuration file using the
`common configuration syntax <configuration_file_syntax>`.

CollectiveAccess supports ID numbers for the following items:

-   objects (*ca_objects*)
-   lots (*ca_object_lots*)
-   entities (*ca_entities*)
-   places (*ca_places*)
-   collections (*ca_collections*)
-   occurrences (*ca_occurrences*)
-   loans (*ca_loans*)
-   movements (*ca_movements*)
-   storage locations (*ca_storage_locations*)
-   representations (*ca_object_representations*)
-   list items (*ca_list_items*)
-   content managed site pages (*ca_site_pages*)
-   tours (*ca_tours*)
-   tour stops (*ca_tour_stops*)
-   sets (*ca_sets*)

You may specify numbering formats for any type of item listed above in
multipart_id_numbering.conf. The format name for each must be identical
to the item code (italicized in the list above). CollectiveAccess will
use the format to generate an ID number entry interface and validate
input for the ID number field of the respective data item. For lots this
is the \'idno_stub\' field; for objects and other items it is the
\'idno\' field.

The following sample multipart_id_numbering.conf configuration is for an
organization employing a lot numbering scheme based upon the year of
acquisition and an automatically assigned incrementing lot number.
Object numbers are based upon the lot number format but with an
additional automatically assigned incrementing item number. In both
number formats, elements are separated with periods (\".\"). The file
specifies a two part number for entities: the first element is a code
taken from a drop-down list of three allowable values and the second
element is an automatically assigned incrementing number. For both place
names and vocabulary terms an automatically assigned incrementing number
is specified.

All formats in the configuration file are located in an associative list
named *formats* The keys of this list are table names for which format
are specified. Each table name key has as its value an associative list
keyed on type. Use the special *\_\_default\_\_* type to specify a
format for use with any type not declared with a specific format.

Each type key has as its value an associative list specifying the
format. The following keys may be placed in the list:

+-----------+--------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Key       | Description                    | Example   | M         |

|           | interface for the format. If   |           |           |

|           | character(s) then leave this   |           |           |

The keys of the *element* associative list are element names. These
names are only used for reference during configuration and to name HTML
form elements and are not presented to the user. They should use only
alphanumeric characters and underscores. Do not include spaces or
punctuation in the names.

The value for each element name in the elements list is another
associative list, this one containing a list of settings declaring the
characteristics of the element. The most important setting to set for an
element is its type which defines the general range of allowable values
and user interface behaviors. The plug-in supports the following types:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type                Description
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  LIST                Element value must be taken from a predefined list.
                      User interface is drop-down list containing
                      allowable values.

  SERIAL              If element value is not set, it will be set to a
                      value one greater than the greatest existing value
                      of the ID number as formed from the element and all
                      preceeding elements in the format. For example, if
                      for the three element format with last last element
                      set to SERIAL 2006 001 001 exists and you enter
                      2006 4, the last element will be set to 5. It is
                      also possible to set the element value manually,
                      but only letters and numbers are allowed.

  CONSTANT            Element is always set to a constant alphanumeric
                      value and cannot be changed.

  FREE                Any input is allowed up to a specified length.

  NUMERIC             Only numbers are allowed.

  ALPHANUMERIC        Only numbers and letters are allowed.

  YEAR                Only valid four digit years are allowed.If empty
                      the element will default to the current year. This
                      is useful when your numbering system includes the
                      current year.

  MONTH               Only valid month numbers (between 1 and 12) are
                      allowed. If empty the element will default to the
                      current month.

  DAY                 Only valid day numbers (between 1 and 31) are
                      allowed. If empty the element will default to the
                      current day.

  PARENT              Automatically set to the identifier value for the
                      parent when a new record is created. This type of
                      element is useful when implementing
                      \"agglutinative\" numbering systems which each
                      level in a hierarchy incorporates the number of its
                      parent. When used this must be the first element in
                      the element list for a format type. Unexpected
                      behaviors may occur if placed in other locations in
                      the element list.
                      
  INHERIT             Set the element value to that of the parent record.
  					  (Available in version 2.0)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond type, there are a number of other settings that can be set for an
element. Some are common to all element types and others are specific to
certain types.

Settings applicable to all types of elements are:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter           Description
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  description         A short description of the element, suitable for
                      display in error messages. You must set this for
                      each element.

  editable            If set to a non-zero value element is presented in
                      the user interface as editable (except for elements
                      of type CONSTANT which are never editable). If
                      omitted or set to zero elements are only editable
                      when empty in the case of user-entered element
                      types (LIST, FREE, NUMERIC, ALPHANUMERIC) and never
                      editable in auto-filled element types (SERIAL,
                      CONSTANT, YEAR, MONTH and DAY)

  width               Display width, in characters, of entry field in
                      user interface.
                      
  prefix              Text to be prepended to element value. Valid for
                      elements of type SERIAL and FREE.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Type-specific settings are:

+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+
| Type         | Parameter    | Description                            |
+==============+==============+========================================+
| LIST         | values       | List of allowable values for the       |
|              |              | element. Used to validate input and    |
|              |              | generate a drop-down list in the user  |
|              |              | interface. Note that the value for     |
|              |              | this parameter is a simple list, not   |
|              |              | an associative list. Ex. values =      |
|              |              | \[eins, zwei, drei, vier\]             |
+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+
|              | default      | Default value for element              |
+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+
| SERIAL       | child_only   | Set to restrict element for use only   |
|              |              | on records with a parent.              |
+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+
|              | zerop        | If set to a non-zero value, the        |
|              | ad_to_length | sequence number is left-padded with    |
|              |              | zeros until its length is equal to the |
|              |              | value. For example, if set to 4, the   |
|              |              | sequence number 17 would be output as  |
|              |              | 0017. The zero padding length does not |
|              |              | affect sequence numbers longer in      |
|              |              | length than the specified value. Thus, |
|              |              | for example, if zeropad_to_length is   |
|              |              | set to 3, the sequence value 7114      |
|              |              | would be output as-is.                 |
+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+
|              | sequ         | For a \_\_default\_\_ type, if         |
|              | ence_by_type | sequence_by_type is set to a non-zero  |
|              |              | value separate numeric sequences will  |
|              |              | be maintained for each type within the |
|              |              | table. If not set (the default) a      |
|              |              | single sequence is shared across all   |
|              |              | types. For example, if the objects     |
|              |              | table is configured with types for     |
|              |              | paintings, drawings and sculptures,    |
|              |              | the default behavior would be to       |
|              |              | number all objects sequentially        |
|              |              | regardless of types (Eg. 1, 2, 3       |
|              |              | \...). If sequence_by_type is set,     |
|              |              | then each type will be numbered        |
|              |              | sequentially, with numbers duplicating |
|              |              | across types. (Eg. Paintings numbered  |
|              |              | 1, 2, 3 \...; drawings numbered 1, 2,  |
|              |              | 3 \...; Etc.).                         |
|              |              |                                        |
|              |              | You can specify the separate sequences |
|              |              | by maintained for some, but not all,   |
|              |              | types within a table, by setting       |
|              |              | sequence_by_type on type-specific      |
|              |              | configuration entries.                 |
|              |              |                                        |
|              |              | From version 1.8, it is possible to    |
|              |              | specify that selected types share a    |
|              |              | single sequence by setting the         |
|              |              | sequence_by_type option to a list of   |
|              |              | types that participate in the          |
|              |              | sequence. When calculating next in     |

# Problems with SERIAL elements

To generate unique values for SERIAL elements the plug-in must query
your CollectiveAccess database. If the database operation fails you may
see the word \'ERR\' instead of the expected numeric value. In versions
prior to 1.8 the underlying database table and fields used to derive the
next number in sequence had to be manually configured for each SERIAL
element using the *table*, *field* and *sort_field* settings. If you are
running an older version and receive an ERR value verify that the table,
field and sort_field element settings are set correctly.

The automatically issued SERIAL values should always be one more than
the largest extant value in your database. If your system is returning
values that are less than the maximum and you have configured different
number formats for different types within the same table, try setting
the `sequence_by_type` setting for each type, which will cause each type
to have its own numeric sequence. By default all types within a table
share a single numeric sequence. This is often desirable, but
significantly differing numbering formats with a single table can cause
the sequence generator to fail. Separating sequences by type can ensure
that usable sequences are created within each type.

The sequence number system relies upon sortable versions of formatted
identifiers to reliably generate new values in sequence. Incorrect
sequence values may be produced if these sortable values are somehow
corrupted. To regenerate correct sortable values try the *reloading sort
values* option in the administrative *Maintenance* menu or the command
line `caUtils <ca_utils>` command using
the *rebuild-sort-values* option.

# Using UUID\'s as identifiers

The UUID numbering plug-in offers a simplified unique numbering system
using universally unique identifiers (UUID\'s). UUID\'s are 128-bit
values expressed as a series of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers. When
appropriately generated they are for all practical purposes unique.

The UUID pluig-in can be enabled on a per-table basis by changing the
[\<table\>\_id_numbering_plugin] values in
[app.conf] to \"UUIDNumber\".

The UUID plugin utilizes the [multipart_id_numbering.conf]
configuration file, but assumes all formats have a single element of
type \"FREE\". If identifier values for existing records have non-UUID
values set, the plugin will overwrite these with valid UUID\'s. To
tolerate invalid UUID values for existing records set the
[dont_overwrite_invalid_guid] option in the format element
used for the UUID value to a non-zero value. (This option is available
as of version 2.0)
