title: Browse.conf
---

CollectiveAccess includes a configurable *Browse Engine* that powers all
faceted browse and search features. The engine is capable of browsing
for, and returning sets of, any of the primary item types: objects,
object lots, entities, places, occurrences, collections and storage
locations. The engine automatically caches both results and generated
facet content to improve performance. If two users perform the same
browse, results for the second browse will be picked up from the cache
saving time. Similarly, facet content, which is often costly to
generate, is shared across similar browses increasing responsiveness.

## Current use

Faceted browse is currently used in the Providence (back-end) \"Find\"
interfaces for all primary item types. It is also used to provide browse
services in the Pawtucket public-access front-end.

## Configuration

Any intrinsic field (ie. a field that is always part of an item such as
extent and extent_units in object lots), metadata attribute or related
authority may be used for browsing. Since every deployment of CA is
different, and the metadata schema varies from one installation to
another, you must tell the browse engine what sorts of information you
want to be browse-able and how that data should be displayed to the
user. This is done by modifying the browse configuration file in
*app/conf/browse.conf.* As with all other CA configuration files,
*browse.conf* is written using the standard CA configuration syntax.

| Top level key| Description |
|----|----|
|cache_timeout| Number of seconds to keep information for a cached browse around before discarding. The suggested value for this key depends upon how the browse is being uses. A cached browse will not reflect changes made to the data since its creation, so for a busy backend system this value should be relative low: 300 seconds (5 minutes) is a reasonable value. For front-end systems where the catalogue data is not changing often, 86400 seconds (1 day) may be a more appropriate value. If you want to disable caching set this key to 0.|
|``<browse_table_name>``| For each item type you wish to support browsing on you must define an associative array attached to the item table name: ca_objects, ca_entities, ca_places, ca_occurrences, ca_collections, ca_object_lots, and ca_storage_locations. The values set in each item array define the behavior of the browse for that item type. These values are defined below.|

For each item type you want to be browse-able, you must define a
top-level key with the item\'s table name (eg. ca_objects for objects)
and as associative array value. The array must contain a facets key
whose value is in turn an associative array defining each available
browse facet for the item type. The keys of the facets array are
arbitrary code name for the facets, it doesn\'t matter what they are so
long as they are unique within the facet list. The values are yet
another associative array which actually defines the characteristics of
the facet. 

By default results returned include only records specifically matching the specified 
criteria. Results may be expanded hierarchically to include all sub-records by setting
the expandResultsHierarchically setting for the specified table to a non-zero value. (Available from version 2.0).

Each facet has a type and some (but not all) of the facet definition
keys are dependent upon this type. The follow types of facets are
currently supported:

| Facet Type | Description |
|----|----|
|authority|Authority facets allow for browsing on cataloguing applied to the browsed item from a related authority. Eg. if you want to browse for objects by place name, you’d set up a facet of type authority with options to cover the places authority.|
|field|Allows browsing on items using an intrinsic field. These include idno (identifier) and the handful legacy intrinsics such as ca_objects extent.|
|fieldList|Allows browsing on lists that are directly related to an item via an intrinsic field. These include the type lists for each item type (eg. browse by object types), access and workflow status.|
|normalizedDates|Allows browsing on date attributes where the values have been normalized, or adjusted to span periods of time. Since dates are often specific to the day (or even hour, minute and second), browsing on unmodified date data is usually undesirable. normalizedDate facets will return browse choices where dates have been collapsed into days, months, years, decades or centuries.|
|attribute|Allows browsing on any simple single-value attribute. Values are presented as-is, so you should only configure browsing on metadata elements that have a relatively small range of possible values. Browsing on an attribute with narrative text content will not work well. Browsing on an attribute with typed-in text indicating materials or location may work well if data quality is relatively high.|
|label|Allows browsing on preferred and non-preferred labels associated with the browsed item. This can be useful for creating index-like lists of titles for a given type of item. Since the facet will list all unique label values for a type of item it is mainly useful in smaller systems with relatively few items or where records share a manageable number of labels. For larger systems with many distinct label values this facet type is likely to provide poor usability and performance.|
|has|Provides a means to browse for items that either have at least one relationship to some other type of item, or for items with no relationships to a specified type of item. The option values for this facet are always “yes” and “no.” This type of facet is primarily useful for retrieving objects with or without object representations (media), but it can also be used for reporting and data quality assessment purposes. For example, this facet could be configured to all retrieval of all objects without an associated entity.|
|dupeidno|Allows browsing for records with identifiers that are duplicated by at least one other record. Facet values are the number of repeats an identifier has. This type of facet is useful for facilitating clean up of data where identifiers have been erroneously reused. Available from version 1.7.7|
|location|Allows browsing for records on current location, as defined in the current location policy configuration (current_location_criteria in app.conf).|
|violations|Allows browsing for records that are in violation of rules in the metadata dictionary. (Note that the metadata dictionary is currently an undocumented feature with no configuration UI).|
|checkouts|Allows browsing for objects based upon checkout status set by the library check in/out module.|
|inHomeLocation|Allows browsing for objects based upon whether they are currently in their home location or not, as defined in the current location policy configuration (current_location_criteria in app.conf). (Available from version 1.8)|

For all types of facets the following configuration keys are defined:

| Facet key | Description | Mandatory?
|----|----|----|
|indefinite_article|The indefinite article to use when displaying the facet label.                      |Yes|
|multiple|If this directive is set to 1 the facet will perform an OR browse instead of an AND browse. With “multiple” a user is able to select more than one value per facet, for example, in a date browse a user can find records cataloged as 1990 or 1991.|No|
|label_singular|The name to display for this facet, in the singular (eg. “place name”).|Yes|
|label_plural|The name to display for this facet, in the plural (eg. “place names”).|Yes|
|description|Description of the facet. This text appears on browse landing page in Pawtucket|No|
|group_mode|The method by which to group facet values for display. Currently ‘alphabetical’, ‘hierarchical’ and ‘none’ groupings are supported. ‘Alphabetical’ mode groups items alphabetically by the first letter in their name; ‘hierarchical’ displays hierarchical facets (authorities only) in an interactive hierarchy browser; ‘none’ simply lists items out.|No|
|individual_group_display|If set to a non-zero value, each group in the facet will be displayed separately and loaded on-demand. This can improve performance in some cases.|No|
|type_restrictions|An optional list of browse item types to restrict use of this facet to. This is useful if you are restricting your browses to specific types of browse items (ex. occurrences of type “exhibitions” only) and want to have different facet configurations for each type-specific browse. By restricting a facet to “exhibitions”, for example, you ensure that it will only appear when you are browsing specifically for exhibitions, or if you are performing an unrestricted browse. You can specify the restrictions are numeric type_id’s or alphanumeric type codes. The latter is generally preferred as it is easier to read, understand and maintain.|No|
|requires|An optional list of facet names, at least one of which must appear in the browse criteria (ie. have been used in the current browse), for the facet to be available. This is useful if you have a facet that is only relevant in the context of a selection limited by another facet. For example, if you have a facet defined for countries and another for state/provinces, you can ensure that the state/province facet is only made available to the user if a country has already been selected for the browse by making state/providence “require” the country facet.|No|
|single_value|f set to a valid facet value, then selecting the facet will browse on the specified value rather than opening up a browse facet display with choices. This option can be useful for facets with one or two values, where explicit links are preferred over a list interface.|No|
|facet_groups|A list of tags (“groups”) to apply to the facet. Facets displayed by the browse engine can be limited using these tags, via the browse engine setFacetGroup() method. Facet groups are mainly useful when you need to have distinct sets of facets display in different contexts.|No|
|relative_to|Browse facets are typically generated relative to the table being browsed. If you are browsing objects, for example, a facet of related entities will display names of entities related directly to objects. relative_to, when set to a table other than the table being browsed, enables you to generate facets with values from a table related to the one you are browsing. You could, for example, generate a facet of birth dates of entities related to objects, or a list of places related to entities related to objects. In effect this is an indirect browse. Even though the facet values are related to the relative_to table, the results of the browse are still the same. relative_to can be very useful when metadata you want to browse by is actually related to a table different than the one you wish to get results for. Value must be a valid item table name (Eg. ca_objects, ca_entities, ca_places, ca_occurrences, ca_collections, ca_storage_locations, ca_list_item, Etc.)|No|
|access|A list of access values to restrict facet visibility to. Access values are numerical values used to control public visibility of records. Each user, authenticated or not, while be associated with one or more access values. For non-authenticated users access values will be those specified in the public_access_settings directive in app.conf. For authenticated users it will be a list of values conferred by the users associated roles. Any user having any of the access values for the facet will be able to use the facet. If this option is omitted or left empty no restriction will be applied. Available from version 1.7.7|No|
|roles|A list of user role code to restrict facet visibility to. Any user having any of the roles listed for the facet will be able to use the facet. If this option is omitted or left empty no restriction will be applied. Available from version 1.7.7|No|


For facets of type **authority** these additional keys are defined:

| Facet key | Description | Mandatory?

|restrict_to_types|An optional list of types *for the item you are browsing by* to restrict the facet to. The types can be internal item_ids for the types or ca_list_item.idno values (eg. list item codes set by the installation profile). This key lets you set up facets that only browse a subset of a given authority: only places of type \'river\' for instance.|No|
|restrict_to_relationship_types|An optional list of relationship types to restrict the facet to. The types can be internal relationship type_ids for the relationship types or alphanumeric type codes (eg. type codes set by the installation profile). This key lets you set up facets that only browse a subset of a given authority: only places linked to objects with relation type \'depicts\')|No|
|exclude_relationship_types|An optional list of relationship types to exclude from the facet. The types can be internal relationship type_ids for the relationship types or alphanumeric type codes (eg. type codes set by the installation profile). This key lets you set up facets that only browse a subset of a given authority: only places linked to objects with relation types other than \'depicts\')|No|
|generate_facets_for_types|If set to a non-zero value, will cause the current facet to be automatically converted into a separate facet for each type of the item type being browsed by. This option is typically employed to provide browsing of occurrences where the various types are unrelated, but you can also use this on other authorities to provide a fine-grained browse without having to hardcode the type hierarchy into the configuration.|No|
|show_all_when_first_facet|If set to a non-zero value, will force this facet to include all items in the authority whether than are related to the underlying browse table or not when the browse has no criteria set (ie. when the facet is the first one chosen in the browse). Default is false.|No|
|order_by_label_fields |A list of fields in authority label table to sort by. You can do multi-level sorting by specifying more than more field in the list. Ascending sort order is assumed. The list should be only field names; do not include the table name|No|
|group_mode|The method by which to group facet values for display. Currently \'alphabetical\', \'hierarchical\' and \'none\' groupings are supported. \'Alphabetical\' mode groups items alphabetically by the first letter in their name; \'hierarchical\' displays hierarchical facets (authorities only) in an interactive hierarchy browser; \'none\' simply lists items out. |No|
|show_hierarchy|Set to non-zero value to display hierarchy on items in this facet; default is to not display hierarchy|No|
|hierarchical_delimiter|Character(s) to place between elements of the hierarchy|No|

|hierarchy_limit|Maximum length of hierarchy to display (leave blank to return hierarchy unabridged)|No|
|hierarchy_order|Direction to display hierarchy in. Can be ASC or DESC (default is DESC). ASC displays the root first; DESC displays the lowest element in the hierarchy first                     |No|
|check_access|Set to non-zero value to only show related items with public access when browsing in Pawtucket. Has no effect in Providence. Default value is to perform access checking.||

|template|Available from version 1.7.6. A template to format returned labels with. This is primarily useful for formatting entity labels, which are comprised of several component fields (surname, forename, middle name, displayname, Etc.). The template is text with label components specified by the field name of the component preceded by a caret (\"\^\"). For example, to format an entity label surname-comma-forename style the template is \"\^surname, \^forename\". If no template is specified the primary display field for the label is used.|No|

## Browse Results When No Criteria are Defined

By default the browse will not return results if you attempt to execute
a browse with no criteria defined. In principle, a criteria-less browse
should return all possible results -- every item in your database.
However, for most data sets such a result set would be of limited use
and slow to render. In most CA Providence and Pawtucket implementations,
a special \"start browsing\" display is used when no criteria are
defined.

If you really do want all results returned when no criteria are defined
you can force it on a per-table basis by setting
show_all_for_no_criteria_browse in the table-level block (the one that
must contain the facets list). See the ca_objects block in the example
below to see how this is done.

## Avoiding Cache Confusion

Browse results are cached for a period of time defined by the
cache_timeout value in your browse configuration. Once cached, a browse
result will be reused until it expires, even if you change your browse
configuration in the meantime. This has the effect of making it almost
impossible to experiment with browse configuration while caching is
enabled. If you are developing or debugging a browse configuration, be
sure to set cache_timeout to zero while you\'re working. Once your
browse is working as you want it to re-enable the cache by setting the
timeout to a reasonable value. Caching significantly improves overall
performance so you\'ll probably want it enabled for every day use.

## Example Configuration

A working browse.conf should look something like this:

``` none
# Browse configuration

# number of seconds to keep cached browses around
# set to 0 to disable caching
cache_timeout = 60

# Configuration for object browse
ca_objects = {
