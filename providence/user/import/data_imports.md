# Introduction to Data Imports

## Data Import: Purpose

In order to get data into a CollectiveAccess system, a data import must be performed. A data import takes data in [various formats](https://docs.collectiveaccess.org/providence/user/import/file_formats) and ingests it into a CollectiveAccess system via an import mapping spreadsheet. 

There are two components to a data import: 

1. The raw data file or files
2. The import mapping spreadsheet
