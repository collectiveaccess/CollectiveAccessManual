# The Media Importer 

## Media Importer UI

The CollectiveAccess media importer UI is the interface through which media is ingested into a CollectiveAccess system. The media importer can be accessed by navigating to **Import > Media.**

Similarly to a data import, a media import requires media files; however, you do not need a mapping to import data into CollectiveAccess. 

## Importing Media in CollectiveAccess

Media is stored in CollectiveAccess via media representation records. Each time media is imported into CollectiveAccess, a new media representation record is created. However, these records are almost always associated with other types of records from primary tables, such as Objects.


## Importing Media using an Import Mapping Spreadsheet

Media can be imported using an import mapping spreadsheet. This method of importing media is not recommended, as it significantly slows down the processing of the data import. However, it is an option for users who wish to do so.

To Come

## Importing Media via the Command Line

Media can be imported in CollectiveAccess using the command line. 

## Importing Media using the Batch Import Tool

CollectiveAccess supports the upload of entire directories of media at once, also known as batch importing. This feature is useful for uploading multiple images or other media files without uploading each file by hand.

For more, see [Batch Media Upload](https://docs.collectiveaccess.org/providence/user/import/Importing%20Media/batch_media).
