    Types](#viewing-available-relationship-types)
-   [Creating Relationship Types](#creating-relationship-types)

All Relationships in CollectiveAccess are reciprocal and are defined by
Relationship Types. Relationship Types are configurable to suit a
multitude of data needs.

Relationship Types can be managed via the CollectiveAccess user
interface. Relationship Types can be created, and also viewed and
edited, in the user interface.

# Viewing Available Relationship Types

To view all possible Relationship Types in a CollectiveAccess system:

1.  Navigate to **Manage \> Administration** in the Global Navigation
    menu.
2.  Select **Relationship Types** from the left sidebar to open the
    Relationship Types viewer.

</figure>

The left-most column displays all of the possible relationships
available between records in the system. These are not editable, but
simply represent different relationships between the relevant primary
tables. For example, the relationship listed between two objects, or
between a place and an entity.

Select these relationship headings to view the different Relationship
Types that have been defined for the system. The selected relationship
will then be **bolded** and the type will display in the right-hand
column:

# Creating Relationship Types

To create a new Relationship Type in the user interface:

1.  Navigate to **Manage \> Administration** in the Global Navigation
    menu.
2.  Select **Relationship Types** from the left sidebar, to open the
    **Relationship Types viewer**.

3.  **Select the Relationship** in the left-hand column to which you
    would like to add a new type. The relationship will show up in
    **bold.**
4.  **Select the Relationship Type** in the right-hand column to which
    you would like to add to. The relationship type will show up in
    **bold.**
5.  **Select the plus icon** ![plus](/providence/img/conrel2.png) next to the message
    \"Add under \[relationship\] new item,\" where \[relationship\] is
    the relationship for which you would like to add a new Relationship
    Type:

6.  The **Relationship Type Editor** screen will be displayed, where
    relevant information for the new Relationship Type can be entered
    and saved:

The Relationship Type Editor screen contains the following information
to add to the newly defined relationship type:

-   **Typename (forward sense)**: The display name of the Relationship
    Type. These are often named so that they complete a sentence. For
    example, in an Entity to Object relationship, one relationship type
    might be "created."
-   **Description (forward sense)**: Describe the relationship type
    here.
-   **Typename (reverse sense)**: This allows you to name the reciprocal
    relationship of the same two primary tables. For example, "created
    by."
-   **Description** (reverse sense):
-   **Relationship type code**: This is a unique name that is used to
    refer to your Relationship Type throughout the system.
-   **Is Default?**: This specifies whether this is the default
    Relationship to appear in the Relationship Type Bundle.
-   **Type Restrictions for \"left\" side of relationship**: Restrict
    the relationship to a chosen subtype. For the \"Birthplace\"
    example, you may want to restrict your Relationship Type to
    \"Individuals,\" as Organizations often don\'t have places of birth.
    This setting automatically generates a list of your configured
    subtypes for the \"left\" side of your relationship.
-   **Type Restrictions for \"right\" side of relationship**: same as
    above, but automatically generates a list of your configured
    subtypes for the \"right\" side of your relationship.
-   **Sort Order**: Determines the order of the Relationship Types as
    they appear in a drop-down menu.
-   **Location in Hierarchy**: The location of the relationship type in
    the Relationship Hierarchy.
