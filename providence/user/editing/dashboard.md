# Dashboard Configuration

CollectiveAccess provides a customizable **dashboard.** The dashboard is
the home screen that displays upon login to any back-end system
(Providence).

The main function of the Dashboard is to display the widgets for your
system. **Widgets** provide specialized functions, and serve as
mini-applications within Providence. The number of widgets in the
Dashboard is entirely configurable, and their arrangement is
customizable to suit a variety of collections and workflows. Every
CollectiveAccess system comes with a specific set of widgets; however,
custom widgets can be created, and widgets can be added or taken away
from any dashboard.

:::note
Widgets can be written and created by any developer. For more on writing
widgets, see [Writing Dashboard
Widgets](/providence/developer/writing_dash_widgets.html?highlight=widget).

## Adding Widgets to the Dashboard

The dashboard in a CollectiveAccess system will usually look like:

demonstration system. From here users can create new records, search for records,
manage administrative information, and import data.*

4.  **Select** the desired widget using the plus icon
    ![plus](/providence/img/dashboard5.png). This will automatically drop it to a
    location on the home screen.

The position of widgets on the Dashboard can be configured. Once widgets
have been selected and added, they will display on the Dashboard.

To change the location of widgets on the home screen, simply **select
and drag** the widget around on the Dashboard. **Drop** the widget in
the desired location.

Once widgets have been configured, select **Done** in the upper right of
the screen above the widget instructions.

## Widget Settings

While still editing the Dashboard, specific settings can be viewed and
configured for each widget. To do so, select the **i** icon
![icon](/providence/img/dashboard6.png) located in the top right corner of each widget.

For each widget, different settings will be displayed that can be
customized. For example, the Counts widget on the Dashboard appears like
this:

![image](/providence/img/dashboard8.png)

When the **i** icon ![icon](/providence/img/dashboard6.png) is selected, these settings
appear that can be customized:

Select or de-select these settings to change the contents that appear in
the widget upon login.

## Removing Widgets from the Dashboard

Removing widgets from the Dashboard is simple. While editing the
Dashboard, simply select the **x** icon located in
the to right corner of each widget.

Select **Done,** and the updated Dashboard will be displayed.
