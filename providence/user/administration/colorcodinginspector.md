CollectiveAccess supports the customization of both the look and feel of
any cataloging interface. Assigning custom colors and icons to the
Inspector window of any record type or record subtype can streamline
workflow, as well as ensure clear differentiation and generate
easy-to-identify parts of any Editor screen.

Unique colors can be assigned for the main Editors for record types
which will extend to all subtypes in the system. Colors can also be
assigned to the individual subtypes. If no custom color is assigned, the
default color will automatically be assigned.

These changes can be made directly in the user interface of any
CollectiveAccess system.

# Inspector Window Features

The Inspector window of a record contains all the key \"at a glance\"
information about that record. This includes its primary table, current
location, title, accession number, media representation (if any), as
well as the various screens containing metadata for that record.

The Window itself also contains five icons from which various features
are enabled:

-   ![eye](/providence/img/inspector_feature_2.png) Watch/Unwatch this Record. Selects
    Watched Items which appear in Manage/My Watched Items. To use a
    shortcut to view specific records, select the Eye icon, which then
    turns red.
-   ![arrows](/providence/img/inspector_feature_3.png) Change Record Type. Changes the
    record type, and discards any unnecessary metadata elements for the
    new type. This cannot be undone.
-   ![page](/providence/img/colorcoding5.png) Duplicate this Record. Duplicates the
    record, with controls that specify what exactly to duplicate.
-   ![house](/providence/img/inspector_feature_5.png) Set Home Location. Specifies a
    home location for the record, where the record is usually kept.
-   ![show](/providence/img/inspector_feature_6.png) See More Information About this
    Record. Collapses or expands the information relating to the
    record's edit history, visible in the Inspector panel.

# **Customizing the Editor Inspector**

Editor screen colors can be customized through the user interface. To
customize the Inspector window in an editor screen:

1.  Navigate to **Manage \> Administration** in the Global Navigation
    bar. This opens the list of available editor screens:

![image](/providence/img/colorcoding1.png)

2.  Open the Editor you wish to customize by selecting the **page icon**
    ![page](/providence/img/colorcoding5.png) on the far right of each available editor
    screen.
3.  This will open the editor page. Scroll down and select the **Color**
    field. Select the Color box to open the color-picker tool, and use
    the arrows to choose the color.

5.  Select Save to save the changes made to the Editor.
6.  Navigate to the record\'s inspector that was updated to view the new
    color.

# Customizing Screens within the Editor

Individual Screens within a record's Editor can also be customized. To
do so:

1.  Navigate to **Manage \> Administration** in the Global Navigation
    bar. This opens the list of available editor screens.
2.  Open the Editor by selecting the same **page icon**
    ![page](/providence/img/colorcoding5.png). The list of available screens which can
    be edited is displayed.
3.  Scroll down to the **Screens** field. Select the screen to be edited
    by selecting the same **page icon** ![page](/providence/img/colorcoding5.png) on the
    far right.
4.  Scroll to the **Color** field. Select the Color box to open the
    color-picker tool, and use the arrows to choose the color.
5.  Select any part of the screen to close the color-picker tool.
6.  Save the changes made to the Inspector.
7.  Navigate to the Editor screen in the record that was updated to view
    the new color.

# Customizing the Inspector for Record Subtypes

Customizing the Inspector for record subtypes allows for further
differentiation between these subtypes. Although Subtypes are
configurable and are therefore different for every CollectiveAccess
installation, a general, hypothetical example is the Object subtype
**Paintings**.

To customize the Inspector for the subtype **Paintings**:

1.  Navigate to **Manage \> Lists & Vocabularies** in the Global
    Navigation bar. This opens the List Hierarchy viewer.
2.  Find the subtype list to use, and select the gray arrow **\>** to
    open the List Item editor (for the example, **Object Types \>
    Paintings** in the List Hierarchy viewer).
3.  Scroll down to the **Color** field. Select the color-picker tool,
    and choose a color.
4.  Scroll down to the **Icon** field.
5.  Save the changes made to the Inspector. After saving the Editor, the
    icon will appear next to this field.
