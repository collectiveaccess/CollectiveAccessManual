# Search Builder 

Search Builder is a method of generating advanced and specific searches within records in CollectiveAccess. The search builder screen contains a full list of all metadata elements used in a specific CollectiveAccess system, which can be selected, with different options to further narrow the search within that metadata element. Search Builder is an ideal tool for searches that will be used to generate custom reports or checklists, as what elements are included or excluded can be completely customized.

## Using the Search Builder

Selecting Search Builder from the four Search and Browse options on the left side of the screen will display the Search Builder interface, which displays a drop-down menu:

## Search Builder for Primary Tables

Similarly to the Browse function, the Search Builder is available to search with for each primary table in CollectiveAccess. And, the drop-down list displayed will differ, depending on the primary table from which the Search Builder is being used.

Options exist to Save the search that was created. Fields and primary tables that show up in the Search Builder are configurable.
