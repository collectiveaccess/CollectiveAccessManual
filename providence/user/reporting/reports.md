## Reports from Search Results

CollectiveAccess supports the generation of custom reports designed to help workflow and meet the needs of any collections organization. Reports can be made from records of any type in CollectiveAccess.

There are are two ways to generate a report of multiple records:

1. Conduct a database Search. Use the Basic Search, Advanced Search, or Browse functions to retrieve the results that will populate your report.

2. Create a Set. Select a Set name under “Search by Set” in the left-side menu of the Search screen and select Search. This will populate your search results with the items from the chosen Set.

In any display configuration, there are several format options for downloading and printing search results and sets. These include:

- Tab delimited files

- Comma Delimited files (CSV)

- Printable PDFs (checklist or thumbnails)

- Word processing files (DOCX)

- An Excel spreadsheet (XLSX)


## Export Tools

Generating a report can be done by conducting a database search. For example, a report for a single object can be made from a search result(s).

Conduct a search in the databse. When results are pulled, an option exists to the right by hovering over the download icon export labelled Export Tools.

Select this icon, and a few options will display in an overlay:

## Download Media for Reports

The Download Media dropdown within Export Tools allows media in various sizes to be pulled from all, or selected, results.

Media can also be downloaded from the media tab of an individual record by selecting the download icon.
