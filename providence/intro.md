# Introduction to Providence

Providence is the “back-end” core cataloguing and data management application of *CollectiveAccess*. Providence provides a relational approach to cataloging that allows users to create and describe relationships between different record-types, construct hierarchical relationships for complex collections, and to do so using commonly accepted library and archive standards. Nuanced search and browse tools, advanced display and reporting tools, batch edit and import capabilities, superior media-handling, and more enables users to catalogue almost anything in any way.

Providence is fully configurable, and users can create and edit metadata fields, user interfaces, and reports without custom programming. It supports complex hierarchies (i.e., collections to items, place authorities, and more) and as a relational database, enables metadata to be accurately interconnected. It can also handle a broad spectrum of digital media formats including high-resolution video, audio, and image files. The robust set of customizable features allows the scope of projects to be expansive and dynamic, accommodating both traditional and more idiosyncratic collections.

Providence can be customized to suit a variety of cataloging needs, and provides many features for catalouging, finding and interacting with data, including: 

- Fully customizable metadata fields, user interfaces, and reports
- Support for audio, video, film, digital media, photographic imagery, and documents
- Management of administrative data relating to use, condition and conservation of materials
- Robust location tracking pertaining to specific materials
- Support for several library and archival standards including DACS, PBCore, Dublin Core, VRA Core, and more
- Integration with Library of Congress subject headings, Getty vocabularies, GeoNames, and other external information services

Providence is a web-based application that runs on a server. As with any web-based application, Providence is designed to be accessed via the internet, enabling collaborative cataloging of collections by widely dispersed teams. However, Providence will function just as well on a local network with no internet connectivity, or even on a single machine with no network connectivity at all. 

The back-end Providence demonstration site provides basic examples of the software's configurable features. Users can view sample data, make changes, try cataloging records, and discover an integrative and relational approach to collections management.
