## About *CollectiveAccess*

[*CollectiveAccess*](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/) is collections management and presentation software maintained by the staff at Whirl-i-Gig and contributed to by the open-source community. The CollectiveAccess  project began in 2003 as a response to the complete lack of non-commercial, affordable, open-source solutions for digital collections management. Almost two decades later, CollectiveAccess has projects on 5 continents, providing hundreds of institutions with configurable, up-to-date collections management software.

CollectiveAccess is a relational database that enables powerful searching and browsing options, while providing opportunities for nuanced web-based collection discovery. It is designed to handle large, heterogeneous collections that have complex cataloging requirements and collections which need support for a variety of metadata standards and media formats. CollectiveAccess has two main components: [Providence](https://camanual.whirl-i-gig.com/providence/) and [Pawtucket](https://camanual.whirl-i-gig.com/pawtucket/). Providence is the core cataloguing application of *CollectiveAccess* where data, media and metadata is input, edited, and managed. Pawtucket is the optional, public web-access tool for digital publication and discovery. Selected features are designed to handle various aspects relating to data modeling, workflow management, web publishing, granular control and digital preservation for a variety of collections.

Whirl-i-Gig, CollectiveAccess’s primary developer, freely distributes everything it develops under the GNU General Public License as part of CollectiveAccess, and offers consulting and development services to clients to ensure they get the most out of the software. Whirl-i-Gig works directly with end-users who require assistance in realizing their projects.

CollectiveAccess is supported by providing various development services to partner institutions. Explore projects [here](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/projects/.).
