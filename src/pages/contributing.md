# Contributing to CollectiveAccess

There are many ways to contribute to CollectiveAccess.

## Support and documentation

You can help other community members by posting to the [support forum](https://support.collectiveaccess.org/) or responding in the [community Gitter chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#collectiveaccess_support:gitter.im)

Alternatively, expanding or improving [this documentation](/) will help too! If you aren't familiar with markdown (which is used to write
pages) you can still offer suggestions or documentation improvements [via the issue
tracker](https://github.com/collectiveaccess/CollectiveAccessManual/issues).

More technical documentation contributors can directly edit CollectiveAccess' [documentation
repository](https://github.com/collectiveaccess/CollectiveAccessManual/blob/main/README.md) - see the `README.md` which describes the technical
aspects.


## Localisation / Translation

[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/collectiveaccess/collectiveaccess-providence/app-locale-messages-pot--develop/). See [the translation
